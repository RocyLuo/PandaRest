This restful api test platform is based on django. It is similar to other tools such as postman and vRest. At the begining, 
I was really worried because there are many rest api test tools or proudcts available. Is it necessary to create a new one from scratch?? Can I make a better one than other tools? My project might not powerful than other tools, but it is under my contorl. I can add any new features that other tools do not have. 


Features:
1. orginized by cases
2. dynamic variable setting
3. custom functions
4. repeat request
5. data-drive test
6. assert by python code
