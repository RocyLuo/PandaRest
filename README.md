This restful api test platform is based on django. It is similar to other tools such as postman and vRest. At the begining, 
I am really worried because there are many rest api test tools or proudcts available. Is it necessary to create a new one from scratch?? 
Can I make a better one than other tools?  My project might not powerful than other tools, but it is under my contorl. I can add any new 
features that other tools do not have.
